<p><strong>New vs. Old</strong>

<p>The steering was always a bit vague when I bought my 1996 Camry. This was eventually quantified when I went to get the car aligned and, according the alignment tech, the front wheels wouldn't even stay in alignment pulling the car out of the garage. After a bit of thinking and trying to measure the play on the outer tie-rod ends using caveman methods, I decided that the steering rack needed to be replaced.</p>
<p>From a step-by-step standpoint, replacing a steering rack-and-pinion isn't really a difficult job in general. One must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect the outer tie rods from the steering knuckles.</li>
<li>Disconnect the power steering lines (if the rack is powered).</li>
<li>Disconnect the steering shaft/joint which is probably splined onto the top of the steering rack (while being extremely careful not to mess up their clock spring).</li>
<li>Remove the mounting bolts from the rack.</li>
<li>Swap the mounting hardware from the old rack to the new one.</li>
<li>Reverse to install</li>
</ol>
<p>Bleeding a power steering rack is trivial, and the only post-install requirement is getting an alignment.</p>
<p>The Toyota Camry falls into a large segment of cars that have a front-engine front-wheel drive configuration. This makes the whole area around the front subframe kind of cozy, and just means there's less room to play with when replacing the steering rack.</p>
<p>Getting the mounting bolts loose that connect the steering rack to the front subframe was really difficult. I did this job on some smaller jack stands, but it would be significantly easier with a lift.</p>
<p>I chose the cheap path and did not buy new outer tie-rod ends for some reason. This was a mistake. I ended up having to replace one of the two outer tie-rod ends anyways during the re-install of the new rack, and should've done both.</p>
<p>Getting the rack out once everything was unhooked was basically like pulling a puzzle piece out through a maze of engine mounts and suspension components. It came out, but just barely cleared everything.</p>
<p>Overall, the job was not extremely difficult. I'd rate the technical skill required at a 4/10, but the swearing factor at a 7/10 simply due to the insane angles required to break the steering rack mounts loose.</p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Always</em> replace both outer tie-rod ends when doing the steering rack. I read this online, but chose to ignore it. I don't do dumb things like that anymore, and have since joined the group of people saying that you should replace both outer tie-rod ends when doing your steering rack. It's worth it for the insurance on your alignment cost alone.</li>
</ul>
