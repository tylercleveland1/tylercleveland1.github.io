<p><strong>A 1990 Miata has appeared!</strong>

<p>By far my best impulse purchase yet- A 1990 Mariner Blue Mazda Miata that I purchased for $2500 on Craigslist 40 minutes after it was listed (mind you, this was purchased in the summer of 2021- Miatas were worth about 4.5k in this condition at time of purchase).</p>
<p>I bought it from an older guy in Washington. This purchase gave me a lesson in Craigslist skills. I was living with my parents at the time, and I had sent an email to the guy asking to buy the car 10 minutes after it was listed with no response. My father, much to my annoyance, insisted on writing his own email 30 minutes later. Sure enough, he got a response and we bought the car 1 hour after. Later I found out the key phrase he used was &quot;I'm just another old guy looking for a fun summer car&quot;. What?!! Clearly I have still have more to learn...</p>
<p>The car only had about 130k miles on the clock. Granted, the paint was in horrible condition. But, it ran and drove pretty well on the test drive. It had no power steering, no A/C, and a 1.6 liter 4-cylinder engine. For those of the Miata orientation it was an early 1.6 base model, so it had the short-nose crankshaft. No viscous LSD or any features, it had manual everything and a cloth top with a zippered plastic rear window. In fact, a previous owner had even deleted the original radio.</p>
<p>The first thing I did for the car was get a new set of wheels and tires. I love BBS basketweaves, and picked up a set locally in rough condition with a new set of tires for cheap.</p>

Looks much better!

<p>During my ownership of the car I did some usual maintenance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radiator, Thermostat, Water Pump</li>
<li>Timing belt</li>
<li>Plugs, wires, thermostat</li>
</ul>
<p>This car burned or leaked some oil, to say the least. I found myself adding near a quart every for every 1000 miles I put on the car. Yikes. No drips ever really appeared under the car when parked, so this engine must've been been hemorrhaging from every valve seal and piston ring on the engine.</p>
<p>That this car still remains one of the purest drives I've ever had. It provides nothing but the essentials, and even though the car is aging the shifter is still far and away the best out of all the cars I've driven.</p>
<p>Other than the oil consumption, the car was such a joy to drive. In fact, I owned a <a href="/cars-owned/1997MazdaMiata/">1997 Mazda Miata M-Edition</a> later and after owning both I can confidently say that given the chance to own a NA Miata again I'd choose a base model. There's something nice about the simplicity of the cloth seats and the lack of anything powered. The only thing I'd want from the M-Edition is the LSD- but I can definitely live without it.</p>
<p>About 6 months after buying this car, I got a killer deal on a <a href="/cars-owned/1997MazdaMiata/">1997 Mazda Miata M-Edition</a> that had all the goodies and features I thought I wanted. It was the last year of the NA, and the top trim level available at the time. NA Miatas are not highway cars in any way, shape, or form. No matter how you write it. I replaced my 1990 Miata with the 1997 Miata to try see it if squeezed any more grand touring-ability out of the name (spoiler alert: it really did not). I then replaced my 1997 with <em>another</em> Miata... it might be an addiction.</p>
<p>So, I ended up selling this 1990 Miata locally for a good price and someone else to build. In hindsight, if I had the garage space at the time I shoud've kept the car and done my first DIY engine rebuild on it. But I'll save that project for another day.</p>
