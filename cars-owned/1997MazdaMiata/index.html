<p><strong>Natural evolution: 1997 Miata M-Edition</strong>

(pictures are from when I eventually sold the car... spoiler alert)</p>
<p>My second Miata was a product of my first Miata and opportunity. My 1990 Miata had no A/C and a few flaws- burned oil, the top was hard to stop leaking, and the paint was in rough shape. The car was at the point that I had to spend a large amount of money to get it to my ideal condition, or I could find a better platform. The better platform presented itself first in the form of this 1997 Mazda Miata M-Edition. It appeared for sale locally not 5 minutes from my house, for a great deal.</p>
<p>The 1997 Miata M-Edition was the last year of the NA Miata, and the top trim level available. It was a one-year only color, Marina Green Metallic over a Tan leather interior with chrome-plated (yuck) 7-spoke wheels. Nearly every single set of these wheels has chrome peeling including the ones pictured. Oh well... I guess they're period correct. It came with all of the available features, including headrest speakers, A/C, power steering, and a torsen limited-slip differential.</p>

<p>Overall the car was in nearly perfect condition. The top had an aftermarket glass window and fit with no leaks, the functions (including the A/C) all worked properly.</p>
<p>I bought the car as a replacement for my original 1990 Miata, hoping that the nicities would make it more road-trippable. It had a <em>slightly</em> taller final drive in 5th gear, but not by much. At 65mph, it would still turn over over 3.5k rpm. This car had the 1.8l engine, the larger of the two available on the NA Miata. It had noticeable more power than the original (130-ish horsepower opposed to 116 horsepower). But by and large it is the same car as the original.</p>
<p>Unlike my first Miata, the paint was in reasonable condition and it looked great in the sun. A lot of people feel that the british racing green is the best green color available for the NA Miata, but for me the Marina Green is a not-too-distant second.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a noticeable improvement over an original NA. But, it didn't satisfy my need for a more all-weather sports car. I owned this Miata for 5 months, then I sold it for a NC Miata (<a href="/cars-owned/2009MazdaMiata/">2009 Mazda Miata</a>)!</p>
<p>During my ownership of the car I did some usual maintenance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radiator, Thermostat, Water Pump</li>
<li>Timing belt</li>
<li>Camshaft seals</li>
<li>Valve cover gasket &amp; CAS O-ring</li>
<li>Plugs, wires, thermostat, other menial parts</li>
</ul>
<p>After owning 2 NA Miatas from both ends of the spectrum, I'd say that no NA Miata can be a useful all-around sports car if you need occasional weather compatibility and occasional highway cruising. These cars would make great second or third cars for in-town sunny-day drives. If I have the chance to buy another (I'm sure I will), I'd get a basics model- cloth seats, power steering, and not much else. I don't think the leather and other features add much to the part of the experience that matters.</p>
<p>Read about my 2009 Miata purchase <a href="/cars-owned/2009MazdaMiata/">here</a>- I think that the NC Miata is the sweet sport for used Miatas you can buy now due to the prices that NA/NB have risen t.</p>
