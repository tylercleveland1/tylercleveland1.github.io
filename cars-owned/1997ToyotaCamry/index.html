<p>My first car! A 1997 Toyota Camry. Not just any Toyota Camry (that is, beige and automatic), but one in grey with a manual transmission! Although, it did come with the famous Camry dent...</p>
<p>This car started my love for the late 90's/early 2000's Toyota Camry, which would later lead me down the path of buying another one and making my first (and hopefully only) rookie car-buying mistake.</p>
<p>It's a pre-facelift 4th gen camry, pre-facelift. In my opinion, the facelifted 4th gen camry (2000-2001) is one of the better looking sedans out there. This one came in somewhere far from that, having the same basic shape but lacking the better-looking headlights and taillights of the facelift car.</p>
<p>When I bought the car it had no issues, other than non-functional A/C. But, it was in great condition and a minor inconvenience during my ownership all things considered. Part of my love for this car comes from how simple everything is. The interior is cloth, and everything is well laid-out. Really, it had nothing even partially notable in terms of functionality. But that's the thing I enjoyed most about it- it's almost entirely quirk-free!</p>
<p>My only complaint was broken A/C. The most annoying part about A/C is that having to fix an A/C system can essentially total most cheap vehicles (this one being $1,500 back in 2019). Once you realize it's not just a sensor, and that the compressor probably died leaving the state of the rest of the A/C components unknown, you would have been better off just buying a car with working A/C in the first place. On this car, the A/C light would just blink indicating compressor shut-off. No A/C charge? Compressor clutch slipping? Bad pressure sensor? Who knows. I eventually decided to poke around and jumped the A/C compressor clutch relay to see if I could get anything out of it. The compressor started up, produced ice-cold air for about 3 minutes of joy, and then proceeded to start making grinding noises. I then put the compressor clutch relay back in place and left the A/C compressor clutch to freewheel for the rest of the car's life. I decided that I preferred my accessory belts intact and not shredded from a siezed compressor pulley.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the life of this car was cut short prematurely a year into it's life. In the middle of a long road trip, one of the spark plugs started to decide that it didn't belong in the cylinder head anymore. Every few miles it would pop out and destroy more of whatever thread had been left in the head. Evidently, one of the spark pugs was horrendously cross-threaded at some point in the car's life. I was stuck in a town in Washington just far enough away from home to justify the cost of towing the car home at the time. I was lucky enough to have a mobile tech happen to stop on the freeway and help me chase the threads in the cylinder head but it was too far gone to save.</p>
<p>I ended up limping the car to a local mechanics shop, where I sold the car to an employee with the issue for a few hundred bucks. I probably could have sourced a cylinder head and swapped it out for fairly cheap, but given the purchase price and value of the car I decided to let it go.</p>
<p>I had to buy another car on short notice and replaced it with a 1996 Toyota Camry (for another article).</p>
