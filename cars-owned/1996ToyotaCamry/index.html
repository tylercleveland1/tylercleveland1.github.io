<p>My second car! And biggest (and last so far) car-buying mistake. After the untimely death of my amazing 1997 Toyota Camry, I was convinced that I needes another Toyota Camry in my life to replace the original. There were 2 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The manual 4th gen Camry is really hard to find</li>
<li>I had to buy a car on short notice to travel back to college</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these comibined to give me the most short-sighted car purchase of my life so far. In all fairness to this Camry, it's still my go-to daily driver when I don't want to drive my Miata and it's still running perfect with no leaks. But getting there was definitely not hassle-free.</p>
<p>When I went to look at the car originally, I had never driven or felt a car with a bad clutch before. I also didn't get a chance to test the car on the freeway during the purchase. It's clear where this is going: I accidentally bought a car with a bad clutch. I will only make that mistake once! So, immediately after purchasing this car, I had to cough up money at a local mechanic to replace the clutch. Things were learned the hard way.</p>
<p>About 6 months later, the car started having alignment issues. It wouldn't hold an alignment. After spending $200 dollars on 2 alignment jobs I found out the rack and pinion was bad. So, I bought a new one and replaced it myself. Not expensive, but replacing a steering rack on a front-engine tranverse-mounted front-wheel-drive car is not something I'd like to do again.

<p>Finally, I replaced the rear struts on the Camry to try and remediate a rear-end clunk. It got quieter, but never fully went away. Suspension work sucks on old cars. A lot of fire was required to remove the bolts that mounted the strut to the spindle.</p>
<p>Lessons I took away from owning this car in hindsight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't buy a car with bad clearcoat, finding one with good paint is not hard. I'm thinking about rattle-canning the car for fun this summer but would rather not have to.</li>
<li>Don't buy a car with a bad clutch (duh)</li>
<li>Sometimes older cars just aren't worth owning... at the age of cars like this, a lot of stuff wears out even though the car gets 30 mpg and is reliable. A way better purchase instead of this would've been spending an extra 3-4k on a sedan that's from the mid 2000's (like a cool Corolla XRS!) so you can have everything this car has, plus ABS and newer safety features.</li>
</ul>
<p>After everything this car is an OK daily driver and has had no issues since it's first repairs. Something about the 3rd and 4th gen Camrys is just so satisfying. They could almost be described as utilitarian. They are exactly what you need a sedan to be and literally nothing more, for better or worse. Both of mine never leaked or burned anything- even at well over 200k miles they still run great.</p>

<p>As a side note- these alloys are cool! I picked these up when I bought the car. They are OEM Toyota equipment, but really hard to find! It took me a while to figure out what they are, they seem to be a special order option on the 2000 or 2001 Toyota Camry.</p>
