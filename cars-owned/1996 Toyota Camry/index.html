<p>My second car! And biggest (and last so far) car-buying mistake. After the untimely death of my amazing 1997 Toyota Camry, I was convinced that I needes another Toyota Camry in my life to replace the original. There were 2 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The manual 4th gen Camry is really hard to find</li>
<li>I had to buy a car on short notice to travel back to college</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these comibined to give me the most short-sighted car purchase of my life so far. In all fairness to this Camry, it's still my go-to daily driver when I don't want to drive my Miata and it's still running perfect with no leaks. But getting there was definitely not hassle-free.</p>
<p>When I went to look at the car originally, I had never driven or felt a car with a bad clutch before. I also didn't get a chance to test the car on the freeway during the purchase. It's clear where this is going: I bought a car with a bad clutch. I will only make that mistake once! So, immediately after purchasing this car, I coughed up money to replace the clutch at a local mechanic that I trusted. Things were learned the hard way.</p>
<p>About 6 months later, the car started having alignment issues. It wouldn't hold an alignment. Come to find out after spending $200 dollars on alignments that the rack and pinion was bad. So, I bought a new one and replaced it myself. Not expensive, but replacing a steering rack on a front-engine tranverse-mounted front-wheel-drive car is not something I'd like to do again.</p>
<p>Finally, I replaced the rest struts on the Camry to try and remediate a rear-end clunk. It got quieter, but never fully went away. Suspension work sucks, a lot of fire was required to get the old ones uninstalled.</p>
<p>Lessons I took away from owning this car in hindsight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't buy a car with bad clearcoat, finding one with good paint is not hard. I'm thinking about rattle-canning the car for fun this summer but would rather not have to.</li>
<li>Don't buy a car with a bad clutch (duh)</li>
<li>Sometimes older cars just aren't worth owning... at the age of cars like this, a lot of stuff wears out even though the car gets 30 mpg and is reliable. A way better purchase instead of this would've been spending an extra 3-4k on a sedan that's from the mid 2000's (like a 2006 Corolla XRS!) so you can have everything this car has, plus ABS and newer safety features.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note- these alloys are cool! I picked these up when I bought the car. They are OEM Toyota equipment, but really hard to find! It took me a while to figure out what they are, they seem to be a special order option on the 2000 or 2001 Toyota Camry.</p>
