<p><strong>The peak of used Miata: 2009 Miata Grand Touring PRHT</strong>

<p>I'll stand behind (and not just because I own one!): The PRHT NC Miata is one of the best sports cars you can get for $15,000 (which is about what I paid for this example, with 90k miles). It's a NC Miata, meaning it was from the 2006-2015 generation of the car. This generation is leaps and bounds ahead of the NA and NB that it replaced, in every way. In my opinion, the NC is the perfect sweet spot for modern car safety and amentities combined with the essence of the original Miata. They capture 80% of the purity of the original with less than half of the pains. It has a good 25 more horsepower over even the most powerful VVT-equipped NB Miata. It has side-impact airbags (which I am sure I'm not alone in caring about). It is mid engined (unlike the NA and NB). And, best of all, it offers a folding hardtop option!</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, a &quot;PRHT&quot; is a type of NC Miata that has a <em>folding hardtop</em>. Yes, a folding hardtop. Gone are the days of spending $2000 on a painted hardtop for your NA or NB Miata, and then having it stolen 5 minutes later in Seattle (seriously, you should follow the Miata PNW free and for sale pages on Facebook. There is at least one &quot;keep an eye out for my stolen Miata hardtop&quot; on there every other week). This car provides the best of both worlds, in a feat of engineering that takes up no extra trunk space. It fits in the same footprint as the soft top. It provides coupe-levels of security from rain and peace-of-mind. It doesn't exactly make the road noise much better than the soft top, but it is worth every pound and penny for the convenience.</p>
<p>A lot of Miata enthusiasts consider the NC Miata to be fat- but in my opinion this criticism is overblown. If you compare this car to a base-model stripper-spec NA miata from an early year, this car seems bloated. The original NA came in at around 2100 lbs, and this NC Miata at 2550 lbs (the heavest NC available). Compared to my 1990 Miata, this car <em>does</em> feel heavier and clunkier. And I will concede that this car (at least in 6-speed form) has a definitively worse shifter feel than the earlier Miatas. But, for the people out there driving a NB Miata, they will be disappointed to find out their car probably weighs in around 2300-2400 lbs. That extra 1500 lbs for the top trim level fully-loaded NC <em>with</em> the folding hardtop is a palatable sacrifice.</p>
<p>There's three unofficial generations of the NC Miata:</p>
<ul>
<li>NC1, from 2006-2008: Rounded exterior styling, poor interior design.</li>
<li>NC2, from 2009-2012: Upgraded engine over the NC1 with better reliability, facelifted exterior that is more angular and maybe a bit too happy.</li>
<li>NC3, from 2013-2015: Slightly improved styling over the NC2. Better trim levels (club) available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The styling of the NC1 is hit-or-miss. Some people prefer the rounded look of the NC1, others prefer the angular look of the NC2 and NC3. But, exterior styling aside, there is no ignoring the functional upgrades of the later models. The engines make the same power but have (allegedly) better internals, and they have a higher redline. It comes with a better sports suspension package. And, the interior lacks the cheap-looking center console of the NC1 and annoying door pocket cupholders.</p>
<p>My car falls into the early NC2 range. To be specific about my car, it is a 2009 Miata Grand Touring trim level, with the suspension package and the premium package. This means it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heated leather seats, Premium audio, Automatic climate control (grand touring)</li>
<li>Keyless start, Xenon headlights, traction control (Premium package)</li>
<li>Bilstein shocks and LSD (suspension package)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it has every option I wanted on the car. The only car that surpasses this in desireability for me would be a NC3 with a brown interior and dark grey exterior, or a NC3 Club PRHT (which is essentially a cloth-seat car with the suspension packages and cool styling).</p>
<p>The main competition for this car comes from the new ND Miata RF, which is the only other Miata with an electric removable roof. I'll break down why I like the NC PRHT better in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The converti-bility: The NC Miata PRHT is a true top-down experience when the top is folded away. The ND RF is more of a targa top for better or worse.</li>
<li>The price: A nice NC PRHT can be found for around 15-16k (early 2022). A ND Miata RF will set you back at least 23k (as cheap as possible). That savings represents a significant portion of the reason why I chose the NC over the ND. Plus, if you want a ND it's a no-brainer to wait for the higher-horsepower 2019+ ND Miatas to come down in price.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more pictures:</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to my 1997 Miata M-edition, got one last picture next to my old one.

<p>The review of the car is glowing. It feels so much tighter than my 1990 and 1997. Granted, it is at least 10 years newer than both, but it's capabilities are clearly significantly higher than the previous two in stock form. It has noticeably more power, and the 6-speed is way more comfortable for highway driving. The car turns just over 3k rpm at 70mph and it is much less painful to drive long distances. The PRHT doesn't insulate noise a ton more, and it does creak, but it provies a feeling of security that the soft top Miatas cannot match. I think this car represents tremendous value as a 15k sports car.</p>
<p>Other cars I considered instead of this car include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An early Porsche Boster (986 or 987.1): Under 20k. Unfortunately a soft top.</li>
<li>An early base Porsche Cayman (987.1 2.7l engine): Around 20k.</li>
<li>A used BRZ/FRS: Around 15k, but they are all beat to death and I'm not a Subaru fan.</li>
<li>Z3 or Z4: Anywhere below 15k, but I'm not a huge fan of the styling ang they're both soft tops.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some notable V8 sports cars for around 15k including the C5 Corvette and CTS-V, but they are significantly larger and more of grand-tourers.</p>
<p>The Miata really fits the budget sports car requirement perfectly. It's affordable, reliable, small, easy to work on, handles great, and still gets 27mpg. The PRHT Grand Touring takes this a step further by nixing some of the common pain points of soft-top cars and also providing a bit more creature-comfort without much sacrifice. That's what makes the NC Miata PRHT worth a second consideration.</p>
